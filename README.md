QloApps is an open-source hotel reservation system and booking engine. And we distribute it for free. With the help of QloApps, anyone can launch his hotel booking website in few minutes.

We are gladly presenting QloApps 1.4.1

This time we have added one of the most demanded features the hotel wise permission. So the admin can now assign hotels to particular employees. These employees will see and manage only the hotels that are assigned to them.

We also added the Additional Facilities feature for the on-desk bookings. So now you can upsell on your backend bookings also.

Additional facilities are now taxable and can be charged on per day basis.

Along with these features, we also resolved one of the most prominent issues the users were facing. Now when you select the checkout status in the orders section then the room inventory will be updated.
